# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a Simple Interest Calculator designed to calculate the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Description

The Simple Interest Calculator helps users quickly compute the interest earned or paid on a principal amount using the standard simple interest formula. This project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Formula

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## Inputs

- Principal: The initial amount of money
- Rate: The annual rate of interest (in percentage)
- Time: The time period in years

## Output

- Simple Interest: The calculated interest amount

## Example

- Principal: 1000
- Rate: 5
- Time: 2 years

Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a simple interest calculator using a clear formula and straightforward inputs.
